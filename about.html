                    <p>I am a junior at Texas A&M University, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer and Electrical Engineering. I am from Houston, Texas and an 
                    strong supporter of the Houston Rockets! I am most interested in anything related to technology due to how it can change the future as well as people's day to day lives. 
                    This was one of the biggest reason that led me to choose to pursue this degree plan. The coding language that I am most proficient in is C++ with some exposure to Java and Python. 
                    In software development, more than the front end side of things, I am more geared towards the backend development due to the vast space of knowledge that one can learn. 
                    The backend development can also help bring technological features to life which is something front end development doesn't do much.
                    <br><br>
                    Some of the hobbies that I have when I am not coding, is to be active by playing sports such as  basketball and volleyball recreationally. 
                    Additionally, I enjoy playing chess due to the challenges that it brings about with every move which helps in building problem solving skills. 
                    Lastly, I like to spend time with my family and go explore the Houston area and eat various different foods.
                    <br><br>
                    The technical skills that I possess vary from C++ to Java to Angular and ReactJS. With the skills that I have developed from my freshman year to now has 
                    allowed me to build on my hard and soft skills. They have allowed me to be determined and not settle for less and to go the extra mile on tasks. These advancements 
                    in my personal growth has opened up an opportunity this summer for me. I will be a part of a group of interns at Visa with a role as a software developer intern.
