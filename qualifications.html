                Some technical skills that I have accomplished is being profficient in C++, Java, React and Wireframe. I have also been actively getting my hands on familiarizing myself with raspberry pi's
                and using it to program motors and senesor to be successful in my robotics research. Some soft skills that I have obtained during my remote internships over the past summers was on how to work
                with a team, communicating with others, as well as leadership skills to have a successful team. Furthermore, I hope to get more technical skills in learning AWS, and SQL which is something I will be using in my internship this summer.

                The technical areas in computer science that I am interested in is related to creating new software design for companies that the public can use. I am also looking to get my hands into artifical intelligence, robotics, and network. 
                The future of programming and computer engineering is into the digitized realm where everything will be based on artificial intelligence. Furthermore, I want to develop new applications or products to make a difference in the world
                or something that can impact people's everyday lives. Using the coding skills as well as the electrical skills that I have learned from my classes, projects as well as internships, I hope to put them to good use.

                The technical areas that I am looking forward to being a part of in the future is being part of the Visa intern group and developing features for the popular transaction app, Venmo. During this time,
                I will be able to learn the structure of Venmo, the backend criteria as well as construct new version to upgrade the app.
