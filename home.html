                    Howdy, I am a junior at Texas A&M University, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer and Electrical Engineering with a minor in Math and Cybersecurity. I am from Houston, Texas and a 
                    strong supporter of the <a href="https://www.nba.com/rockets/">Houston Rockets</a>!

                    I am most interested in anything related to technology due to how it can change the future as well as people's day to day lives. 
                    This was one of the biggest reason that led me to choose to pursue this degree plan. The coding language that I am most proficient in is C++ with some exposure to Java and Python. 
                    In software development, more than the front end side of things, I am more geared towards the backend development due to the vast space of knowledge that one can learn. 
                    The backend development can also help bring technological features to life. The server side of backend is something that I want to work with in the future as well as behind the scenes payment processes.
                    The reason backend development is eye catching to me because it creates a database and helps maintain the technology needed for the front end so the users can utilize it. </div>

                    Some of the hobbies that I have when I am not coding, is to be active by playing sports such as basketball and volleyball recreationally. 
                    Additionally, I enjoy playing chess due to the challenges that it brings about with every move which helps in building problem solving skills. 
                    Lastly, I like to spend time with my family and go explore the Houston area and to eat various foods. I am a foodie and in the future I am looking to create my own instagram page 
                    reviewing local foods and restaurants!</p></div>

                    The technical skills that I possess vary from C++ to Java to Angular and ReactJS. With the skills that I have developed from my freshman year to now has 
                    allowed me to build on my hard and soft skills. They have allowed me to be determined and not settle for less and to go the extra mile when working on any task, big or small. These advancements 
                    in my personal growth has opened up an opportunity this summer for me. I will be a part of a group of interns at <a href="https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/visa-university.html">Visa</a>
                    with a role as a software developer intern. I will be talking more about my experiences 
                    and future experience in the portfolio section of my page!
